    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    " \n",
    "## What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major benfits is the models' simplicity in constructing classifiers, and that it only requires a small number of training data to estimate the parameters necessary for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Naive Bayes learners and classifiers can be extremely fast compared to more sophisticated methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of model assume that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable, whereas in many real-life data the inputs may be subtly dependant (e.g. salary is actually related to age, education, country of origin etc.)\n",
    " \n",
    "While naive Bayes is known as a decent classifier, it is known to be a bad estimator, so the probability outputs can not be relied upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Baysian models work well, when the priors are (or can be assumed to be) normally distributed (such as ages, income, education, hours per week etc.) but does not work well when they are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have several columns of continuous data, and this model doesn't require 'binning' of data (which may actually  throw away useful information). In fact, it is a typical assumption is that the continuous values associated with each class are distributed according to a Gaussian distribution and so perfect for this model type.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are simple to understand and interpret giving a 'white box' for humans to inspect. They can easily be extended for new scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even with little data available, a decision tree can be useful. Important insights can be generated based on experts describing a situation (its alternatives, probabilities, and costs) and their preferences for outcomes.\n",

    "They can be also be combined with other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "They are unstable, meaning that a small change in the training data can lead to a large change in the struture of the optimal decision tree. It is difficult to get very accurate results without extreme overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",

    "Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be used for any type of classification task, such as classification of images. A more specific example, would be classifying images of fruit coming down a conveyor belt to automatically detect and remove damaged/rotten fruit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is hand-written character recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "Good for assigning inputs to one of two categories - perfect for this exercise. The training attempts to separate the data points are clearly as possible, helping to make the results on unseen inputs quite accurate. It is best used with labelled data like we have here, but there are some preparatory steps to pre-cluster data before training on unlabelled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A special property is that they simultaneously minimize the empirical classification error and maximize the geometric margin; hence they are also known as maximum margin classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Via the so-called kernel trick, SVMs can map feature vector inputs into a high-dimension space, making very complex models possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs require labeling of input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While they are great at binary classification, for tasks with more than two classes there needs to be additional SVMs to sub-classify the data - effectively requiring multiple models run in series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally - even when a model performs well, it is a \"black box\" of sorts. It is very hard to inspect and correctly interpret the decisions made by the model.\n",

    "However, it is also very commonly used in the medical field to predict the risk of developing a given disease based on observed characteristics of the patient (age, sex, body mass index, results of various blood tests, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",

    "The output can take only two values, \"0\" and \"1\", which represent outcomes such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows one to say that the presence of a risk factor increases the odds of a given outcome by a specific factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like other forms of regression analysis, logistic regression makes use of one or more predictor variables that may be either continuous or categorical. \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is unique in that it may be estimated on unbalanced data, rather than randomly sampled data, and still yield correct coefficient estimates of the effects of each independent variable on the outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is more difficult to evaluate the goodness of fit since R^2 values can't be applied and it is hard to interpret the coefficients of the trained model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is built with the limitation that the dependent variable is binary - which is the case with our data. Secondly, the predicted values are probabilities of 0 or 1 so in effect give us the probability of particular outcomes, giving us in effect a confidence score.\n"

The model is probably better because of how it works - namely to find a way to separate the two groups of people (those earning > 50k and those under 50k) by laying them out and drawing a virtual line between them in such a way as to maximise the space around that line. By making that separation as clear as possible, we make it more likely that we will correctly guess the earning of a new unknown person based on what we know about them (age, profession, marital status, country of origin etc.). Once the model is 'trained' on the sample data, it can guess the earnings very quickly."

    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",

    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
