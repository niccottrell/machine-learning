    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "In the code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.\n",
    "  - Use a `'random_state'` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    "  - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Calculate the number of records equal to 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data.\n",
    "  - Store those values in `'samples_1'`, `'samples_10'`, and `'samples_100'` respectively.\n",

    "After testing 3 candidate approaches, and reviewing the results of visualizations above (most importantly the bottom right \"F-Score on Training Set\" table), using *Linear Support Vector machine* for this task gives the best results for our requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "I tested on different subsets of the data and in almost all cases the DT gave the highest *accuracy* scores on training data - probably indicating overfitting. On the test set, all 3 models gave almost identical accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the F-score metric was evaluated for the same cases, the SVM approach is the close winner here over logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy and recall is high for both, but the SVM took almost twice as long to train as the DT. However, the time for *predicting* from the models was about the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that the data available probably has many correlations amongst the inputs which possibly makes some other models perform less well (e.g. Logistic regression performs best where the input variables are indepdendent). Whereas the DT does a decent job of fitting based on steps on single features, the multi-dimensionality of SVMs lets the model consider relationships between features to better divide the data into two sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "While DT gives us some human interpretable structure, the untuned SVM already gives better results and can probably deliver even better with some tuning, so I finally recommend the **Linear Support Vector Machine** model for this project."

    "We ended up choosing between a Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and a Support Vector Machine model. The decision tree model would have been relatively easy to interpret and once the model is trained, we could explain the findings of the fitting stage to teach staff how to manually identify candidate donors. The SVM, although harder to understand, gave the best results.\n",
    "\n",
    "An SVM model is a representation of the training multi-dimensional input as points into a space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible [1]. By spacing them as much as possible, the idea is that new 'real' data will be more accurately classified. These models are very good at and so mostly used in classification problems [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "See in the diagram below that the training has found a way to separate the data points into two groups (marked as black and white) by the widest margin possible. \n",
    "![SVM visualized with margin](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Svm_max_sep_hyperplane_with_margin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to actually arrive at this solution: one called the \"Kernel trick\" can be used when the data can't be separated by a straight line, when it's more like points inside a circle vs. all the points outside the circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, however, most solutions are achieved by iterating in a method called gradient descent. The algorithm starts with a random separation, thenmakes a quick analaysis of the where the data points lie against it's first attempt. Then i makes a small changes to the location of that line (or circle) to get one step closer to the optimium results. It repeats these small changes until it can't do any better. At this point the margin between the points is separated as much as possible and this is the model that should give the best result on real data (i.e. it makes the model more robust).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SVMs are effective when there's lots of different dimensions (columns) in the data. They work well both with small data sets, and very large ones. They are quite versatile and work for many different distributions of data points [3] (although not on very 'noisy' datasets where many points are mixed amongst others)[4]. But they can't give us any probabibility score on how accurate they think they classification is, whereas some other types of models can. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the SVM did take a long time to train on our donor data, the accuracy was slightly better than the other models. This type of model is naturally suited for this problem because of how it works - namely to find a way to separate the two groups of people (those earning > 50k and those under 50k) by laying them out and drawing a virtual line between them in such a way as to maximise the space around that line. By making that separation as clear as possible, we make it more likely that we will correctly guess the earning of a new unknown person based on what we know about them (age, profession, marital status, country of origin etc.). Once the model is 'trained' on the sample data, it can guess the earnings very quickly.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
